# Chapter 1

Once upon a time, there was a girl named Steph. She lived in a small town surrounded by mountains and rivers. One day, while reading a book about great inventors, she discovered an exciting place called Carnegie. It was famous for its inventions and rich history. Intrigued, Steph decided that she wanted to go on a journey to Carnegie.

Steph packed her backpack with snacks, a notebook, and her favorite book. She set off early in the morning, with the sun rising behind her. As she walked down the path, her heart raced with excitement. Along the way, she saw colorful flowers dancing in the breeze and listened to the cheerful songs of birds. But deep down, she felt a tiny bit anxious about what lay ahead.
