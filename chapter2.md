# Steph's second step

After walking for a few hours, Steph reached a small river. The water sparkled under the sun like tiny diamonds. Then, she noticed a bridge and decided to cross it. As she stepped onto the bridge, she felt a little shaky, but she took a deep breath and continued. On the other side, she met an old woman named Mae who was feeding the ducks.
“Hello, young traveler,” Mae said with a warm smile. 
“I’m going to Carnegie,” Steph replied. “I want to learn about all the great inventions! ”
